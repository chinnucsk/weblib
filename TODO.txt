General
-------

- Rename newslib to newslib_app?


XML parser
----------

- Add encoding handling and Unicode decoding

- Parse XML namespaces.
  
  Maybe tag callback should pass the following information?

    {startElement, Uri, LocalName, QualifiedName, Attributes}

    where: Attributes = [{Uri, Prefix, AttributeName, Value}]

    and: {endElement, Uri, LocalName, QualifiedName}

  Need to unificate XML callback module interface and possible future HTML
  callback module interface

- Check character references for valid range?

- Try to optimize references handling

- Add callback for ignorable whitespace?

- Parse entity declarations?

- Parse/ignore <!DOCTYPE

- Allow start_element callback say to parse tag content as characters? Need
  to be careful with CDATA sub-elements.

- Add independent callback interface (or just function) to request decoder?


FeedParser
----------

- Remove spawn_monitor in favor of spawn_link

- Define callback module interface

- Tests

- What about encodings other than Unicode encodings?


HTTP client
-----------

- Handle Transfer-Encoding headers (see also HTTP/1.1 support below). Also
  ignore Content-Length if Transfer-Encoding is present.

- Add support for methods other than GET and HEAD. Maybe behaviour interface
  also need to be updated for example to transfer big files with POST method.

- Add support for different content codings

- Add Options argument to http_connect()? Maybe only for timeouts?

- HTTP/1.1 support: chunked transfer coding, persistent and pipeline
  connections.

- HTTP version switch

- HTTPS support

- TCP6 support?
