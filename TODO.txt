HTTP client
-----------

- Need a proper way to handle redirects in behaviour callbacks. Is it enough to
  return {stop, _} from handle_headers()? We need a way to return result of
  redirected request as result of the main request.

- Ignore body for 1xx, 204 and 304 status responses (and all responses to a
  HEAD request) as per RFC-2616

- Handle Transfer-Encoding headers (see also HTTP/1.1 support below). Also
  ignore Content-Length if Transfer-Encoding is present.

- Add support for methods other than GET. Maybe behaviour interface also need
  to be updated for example to transfer big files with POST method.

- Add Options argument to http_connect()?

- Normalize HTTP headers inside format_headers()

- Support responses without Content-Length

- HTTP/1.1 support: chunked transfer coding, persistent and pipeline
  connections.

- Maybe we need to parse (some) HTTP header values?

- TCP6 support?
