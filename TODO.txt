HTTP client
-----------

- Handle Transfer-Encoding headers (see also HTTP/1.1 support below). Also
  ignore Content-Length if Transfer-Encoding is present.

- Add support for methods other than GET and HEAD. Maybe behaviour interface
  also need to be updated for example to transfer big files with POST method.

- Add Options argument to http_connect()? Maybe only for timeouts?

- HTTP/1.1 support: chunked transfer coding, persistent and pipeline
  connections.

- TCP6 support?
